i3 is a tiling window manager, completely written from scratch. The target 
platforms are GNU/Linux and BSD operating systems, our code is Free and Open 
Source Software (FOSS) under the BSD license. i3 is primarily targeted at 
advanced users and developers.

Inspired by vimtutor, this tutor is written by Paul Sajna based on the i3 user 
guide by Michael Stapelberg. If you find something missing from the tutor 
please file a github issue at https://github.com/sajattack/i3tutor/issues.
If you have difficulty with i3 unrelated to this tutor you can ask for help
at https://www.reddit.com/r/i3wm, contact us on irc (preferred) or post your
question(s) on the mailing list.

It is important to remember that this tutor is set up to teach by use. That 
means that you need to execute the commands to learn them properly.  If you 
only read the text, you will forget the commands!

This tutor will teach the default keybindings of i3, but it will also teach
you how to modify these keybindings by editing the configuration file. i3 is 
all about customization. It is very powerful.

                Lesson 1.1 Opening terminals and moving around
                

Throughout this tutor, the keyword $mod will be used to refer to the configured
modifier. This is the Alt key (Mod1) by default, with the Windows key (Mod4) 
being a popular alternative. i3-config-wizard should've asked you which 
modifier to use when i3 first opened and generated your config file.

This tutor opened the terminal you are reading this in. To open another one
yourself, press $mod+Enter. i3 will place it next to the current one, splitting
the screen size in half. Depending on your monitor, i3 will put the created 
window beside the existing window (on wide displays) or below the existing
window (rotated displays).

To move focus between the two terminals you can use the direction keys which
you may know from the editor vi. However, in i3, your homerow is used for these
keys (in vi, the keys are shifted to the left by one for compatibility with
most keyboard layouts). Therefore, $mod+j is left, $mod+k is down, $mod+l is up
and mod+; is right. So to switch back to the tutor, use $mod+j. Of course you
can also use the arrow keys.

                      Lesson 1.2 - Splits and containers
                      

At the moment, your workspace is split (it contains two terminals) in a 
specific direction (horizontal by default). Every window can be split 
horizontally or vertically again, just like the workspace. The terminology is
"window" for a container that actually contains an X11 window (like a terminal
or browser) and "split container" for containers that consist of one or more
windows. 

To split a window vertically, press $mod+v before you create the new window.
To split it horizontally, press $mod+h. Let's split our two terminals into
four. From the tutor, press $mod+v, then $mod+enter, then move to the right
with $mod+; and do the same. Excellent. Don't forget to switch back to the
tutor with $mod+j

A split container can have one of three layouts, split, stacking, or tabbed.
Split windows are sized so that every window gets an equal amount of space in
the container. In the next lesson we'll go over stacking and tabbed layouts.
For now just remember that $mod+v splits vertically and $mod+h splits 
horizontally.

                    Lesson 1.3 Stacking and tabbed layouts
                

With a stacking layout, only the focused window is displayed. You get a list of
windows at the top of the container.

In a tabbed layout, the window list is only a single line which is vertically
split, just like in your favourite web browser.

Let's try it out. From the tutor, press $mod+s to switch from a split layout
to a stacking layout. You should see the terminal to the right disappear.
But don't worry, it's not really gone. You can still see the title of the 
window below the title of the tutor window. To bring it back up, press $mod+k,
then return to the tutor with $mod+l.

Now let's turn the bottom two terminals into a tabbed layout. From the tutor,
press $mod+k twice to select the leftmost terminal and then $mod+w for tabbed
mode.

$mod+e is used to switch back to split layout. See if you can bring back our
4 terminal split layout on your own.
